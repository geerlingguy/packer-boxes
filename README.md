# Packer Example - Ubuntu 16.04 minimal Vagrant Box

**Current Ubuntu Version Used**: 16.04.2

**Pre-built Vagrant Box**:

  - [`vagrant init geerlingguy/ubuntu1604`](https://vagrantcloud.com/geerlingguy/boxes/ubuntu1604)
  - See older versions: http://files.midwesternmac.com/

This example build configuration installs and configures Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 minimal using Ansible, and then generates two Vagrant box files, for:

  - VirtualBox
  - VMware

The example can be modified to use more Ansible roles, plays, and included playbooks to fully configure (or partially) configure a box file suitable for deployment for development environments.

## Requirements

The following software must be installed/present on your local machine before you can use Packer to build the Vagrant box file:

  - [Packer](http://www.packer.io/)
  - [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)
  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (if you want to build the VirtualBox box)
  - [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) (or Workstation - if you want to build the VMware box)
  - [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)

## Usage

Make sure all the required software (listed above) is installed, then cd to the directory containing this README.md file, and run:

    $ packer build ubuntu1604.json

After a few minutes, Packer should tell you the box was generated successfully.

If you want to only build a box for one of the supported virtualization platforms (e.g. only build the VMware box), add `--only=vmware-iso` to the `packer build` command:

    $ packer build --only=vmware-iso ubuntu1604.json

## Testing built boxes

There's an included Vagrantfile that allows quick testing of the built Vagrant boxes. From this same directory, run one of the following commands after building the boxes:

    # For VMware Fusion:
    $ vagrant up vmware --provider=vmware_fusion
    
    # For VirtualBox:
    $ vagrant up virtualbox --provider=virtualbox
